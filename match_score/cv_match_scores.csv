Kimberly Davis,kimberlydavis49@gmail.com,+1-902-7711,Product Manager,70,"While Kimberly's CV shows strong relevance for a Product Manager role, it falls short in several areas compared to the job description's requirements. Here's a breakdown of how we arrived at this score:

**Strengths:**

* **Product Management Experience**:  Kimberly's experience as a Product Manager at DEF Ltd. (2017-2021) directly aligns with the ""Required Skills"" and ""Required Experience"" section of the job description, especially in product development and launch cycles.
